personal_calc
=============

A personal calculator project.

This project is a small project which I have started in order to teach myself better coding practices and skills in C++. It began as an extension of a class
assignment in my EECS 211 class at Northwestern University.

I hope to include the following functionality in the calculator:

	- Basic mathematical functionality, +, -, *, /, ^, % (modulus).			-- 100%
	- Basic computer shorthands, ++, --, +=, -=, *=, /=.					-- 100%
	- Basic logic computation, ==, <, >, <=, >=, !=.						-- 0%
	- Basic variable storage												-- 80% (limited number of variables)
	- Follows mathematical order of operations in computation.				-- 100%
	- Matrix handling functionality, incl. transformation, inverse, etc.	-- 50%
	- Higher-level math functions, sin, ln, max, with arbitrary # arguments -- 0%
	- User-defined functions with predefined # of arguments					-- 0%
